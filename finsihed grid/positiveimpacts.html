                <div class="what"><p>There are many different ways that people, including you, can avoid fast fashion. Some basic ways to do this is to try shop from sustainable and ethical brands. Doing a bit of research to find out what ethical brands sell clothes you may be interested in. Mighty good basics, Outland denim, Nature baby and AS color. The brands stated are all ethical New Zealand brands which I recommend looking into and supporting. </p></div>
                <div class="what"><p>Buying less often and when you do, buying high quality clothing that lasts a while is another simple way to avoid fast fashion. Instead of rebuying brand new clothes you  should try to shop second hand. There are so many thrift shops around Auckland, going to check out these shops is fun as well as ethical. A few extra ways could include shopping locally. This could include going for a walk and finding out some cool shops located near you. Another way is by selling or donating clothes.  </p></div>
                <div class="what"><p>There are many ways to sell clothes and many websites to use. One website which is easy to use in New Zealand is <a class="link" href="https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/">Trade Me</a>. Trade me is easy to use and realiable. All you need to do is take photos of the clothes you want to sell and then put them online with a price and description. You could also start considering what materials are being used. You could do this by doing some research on materials and what are the ethical and sustainable ones. </p></div>
