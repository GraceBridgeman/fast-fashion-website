                <div><p class="what">When the seasons changed or we outgrew our clothing, going shopping for clothes used to be a rare occurrence that happened a few times a year. But something changed approximately 20 years ago. The cost of clothing decreased, fashion cycles accelerated, and hobby shopping emerged. The worldwide chains that now rule our high streets and online shopping are fast fashion. But what is fast fashion? </p>
                <p class="what">The fashion industry is one of the biggest, most loved industries in the world and also one of the most harmful. Fast fashion has an instrumental effect on many different aspects of the environment, people and economy.

                <div class="backgroundbox1"><h5>Who?</h5></div>
                <div><p class="what">Fast fashion also has an effect on a variety of human rights issues, particularly in developing nations where fast fashion retailers and their suppliers can take advantage of cheap labour and inadequate environmental restrictions. 80% of clothing, according to the nonprofit Remake, is produced by young women between the ages of 18 and 24. </p>
                <p class="what">The fashion sector in Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, Vietnam, and other countries has been found to use forced labour and child labour, according to a 2018 US Department of Labor report. In textile factories all around Southeast Asia, the pandemic made harassment and gender-based violence worse. Even though production goals remained increasing throughout this time, worker pay was considerably reduced.</p></div>

                <div class="backgroundbox1"><h5> When?</h5></div>
                <div><p class="what">Fashion was sluggish prior to the Industrial Revolution and the development of the sewing machine. People produced their own clothing and took the time to fix them as needed. Clothing was frequently made specifically for each person and was designed to last a lifetime. Imagine if that were typical! Eventually, individuals started dressing more for fashion and less for functional qualities like durability.</p>
                <p class="what">The term "fast fashion" was first used by the New York Times in the 1990s to describe the mass production of low-quality clothing, with Zara's new accelerated production model serving as their model. In this model, clothing was produced quickly from the design stage, with inspiration from Fashion Week, to the stores for anyone to purchase. Fast Fashion will continue being produced for decades.</p></div>
