                <p>If you were to pull every clothing item out of your wardrobe do you think you would be able to name where each piece was manufactured and by who? I assume most of you reading this would have no idea. As consumers in our generation we have a want and need for the latest trends and styles of clothes. Fast fashion contributes to supplying that want and need in the worst ways possible. To describe fast fashion it is basically the mass production of cheap, trendy, bad quality clothing. The negative impacts fast fashion has on the world are endless affecting the environment and the people and it's time we do something about it.</p>
                <p>Fast fashion is an issue in the world that is rarely talked about. This website will educate and inform you about the negative impacts of fast fashion. These impacts include the environment and the people. It includes stats and graphs on how much clothing is wasted as well as links to websites which sell ethical clothing. This will help all end users start putting the advice and information from my website to use. The website will include not only the negative impacts but also different ways that the students can positively change their role in contributing to fast fashion.</p>
                <p>I will include better alternatives to getting rid of clothes more sustainably and information on what brands users should buy from. Sustainability has three pillars to it: economic, social and environment. I will go into more depth on this in my website. Users will also be able to visually learn on my website as I will include photos and videos. Once students have a better understanding about the issue I hope that they can take their learning and act on it. </p>
                <p>Many different businesses are involved in fast fashion including H&M and Zara. Fast fashion happens all over the world and it is caused by consumers wanting more and more and people wanting to get up to date with the latest fashion trends. The big companies push and encourage people to want products faster and more often. The end users for my website will be students at diocesan school for girls. My website will be aimed at girls aged 13-18 as their generation very much revolves around fashion and shopping. Also girls this age are either beginning to gain maturity or have already matured meaning they will take the information on my website more seriously. There is a big variety of girls at dio between the ages of 13-18 (year 9-13) who all shop at different places and buy different things however the influence of society and the want and need for new styles and trends impacts this age group hugely. My website will be accessible to the end users on both phones and laptops. </p>
